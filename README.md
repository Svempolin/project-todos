Project Todos

This project was to train redux by building a todo app. The app should have components a reducer and was suppose to be styled with style comconponens. 

The problem
I had a bit of a hard time seeing the app in front of me and therefore could not sketch down what I wanted it to look like.  Feel that I understand how redux works but lack the knowledge of how I can build my own reducers. Styling always takes a very long time.
